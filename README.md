# What is Push Swap?

•Lorm spum


## How to run - Samples


```sh
# Samples of commands
$> cmd1
$> cmd2

# Commands by program


# Command by terminal

```






## `More information`


• Libft allowed.

• Folder structure apply (managed by Makefile).

• No leaks are allowed.

• Norma must be run.

• Linked List

•  Algorithm that sorts by index and position.

### `Operations`

- sa : swap a - Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
- sb : swap b - Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
- ss : sa and sb at the same time.
- pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do - nothing if B is empty.
- pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if A is empty.
- ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack A by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack B by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- rr : ra and rb at the same time.
- rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack A by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack B by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
- rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.



## `To Run`

```sh
# Will generate a executable in bin folder
$> make run

# Execute valgrind. Will check memory leaks
$> make leak

# will run norminette inside de .c files (src folder)
$> make norma

```
